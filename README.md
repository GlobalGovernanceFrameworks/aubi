# AUBI Framework
## Adaptive Universal Basic Income

Welcome to the AUBI Framework implementation! 🌍💰

## What is AUBI?

The **Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) Framework** is a revolutionary approach to economic security that goes beyond traditional UBI by integrating care, ecological stewardship, and cultural contributions into a comprehensive 4-layer system. AUBI serves as the **economic backbone** of the [Global Governance Frameworks](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org) ecosystem, ensuring freedom from survival anxiety while rewarding meaningful contributions to community and planetary wellbeing.

### Core Innovation: 4-Layer Payout System

**Layer 1: Universal Baseline** (Unconditional)
- Hybrid 70% fiat / 30% Hearts currency
- Covers basic needs: housing, food, healthcare, education
- Ensures dignity and freedom from survival work

**Layer 2: Contribution Bonuses** (Hearts/Leaves)
- Care work, cultural preservation, ecological stewardship
- Validated via Love Ledger and Community Weavers
- Dynamic rewards based on community impact

**Layer 3: Equity & Reparations** (Justice-based)
- Historical injustices, geographic disparities, accessibility needs
- Addresses systemic inequalities through targeted support
- Portable for migrants and refugees

**Layer 4: Global Stabilization** (System-wide)
- Prevents inflation, ensures cross-regional balance
- Managed by Social Resilience Council
- Crisis response and economic stability mechanisms

## Ecosystem Integration

AUBI connects with complementary frameworks to create a complete regenerative economy:

### 🏛️ [Emergent Governance Protocol (EGP)](https://github.com/GlobalGovernanceFrameworks/egp)
- **Connection**: AUBI provides economic security enabling meaningful participation in governance
- **Integration**: Layer 2/3 bonuses can fund community proposals via EGP's `propose()` system
- **Empowerment**: Freedom from survival anxiety enables citizens to engage in long-term thinking

### 💚 [Love Ledger](https://github.com/GlobalGovernanceFrameworks/love-ledger)  
- **Connection**: Love Ledger validates contributions that earn AUBI Layer 2/3 bonuses
- **Integration**: Hearts/Leaves currencies distributed as AUBI payments
- **Validation**: Community Weavers ensure cultural alignment and prevent gaming

### 🌍 Framework Ecosystem
- **[Work in Liberation Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/work-in-liberation)** - Organizing meaningful work via Community Work Teams
- **[Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge)** - Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) with sovereign AUBI implementation
- **[Financial Systems Framework](https://globalgovernanceframeworks.org/frameworks/financial-systems)** - Hearts/Leaves currency mechanics and Inter-Currency Translation Layer

## Key Differentiators from Traditional UBI

| **Aspect** | **Traditional UBI** | **Adaptive UBI (AUBI)** |
|------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Philosophy** | Welfare safety net | Expression of Right Relationship and Treaty social contract |
| **Payments** | Fixed fiat amount | 4-layer system with Hearts/Leaves integration |
| **Conditionality** | Fully unconditional | Unconditional baseline + voluntary contribution bonuses |
| **Metrics** | Poverty reduction focus | Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI) |
| **Governance** | State-administered | Community-controlled via Social Resilience Council |
| **Cultural Integration** | One-size-fits-all | Indigenous-guided, BAZ-adapted implementation |
| **Ecological Focus** | None | Leaves rewards for planetary health contributions |

### Payment Distribution
```json
{
  "citizen_id": "did:example:maria",
  "location": "baz:taos",
  "monthly_payment": {
    "layer_1_baseline": {
      "fiat": 840,
      "hearts": 360,
      "total_usd_equivalent": 1200
    },
    "layer_2_bonuses": {
      "care_hours": 20,
      "hearts_earned": 400,
      "leaves_earned": 15,
      "multiplier_applied": 1.2
    },
    "layer_3_adjustments": {
      "equity_bonus": 200,
      "reason": "rural_geographic_adjustment"
    }
  },
  "validation": {
    "community_weaver": "did:example:elder_rosa",
    "love_ledger_hash": "bafyrei...",
    "cultural_verification": "traditional_council_approved"
  }
}
```

### Integration Points
- **Love Ledger**: Contribution validation and Hearts/Leaves distribution
- **EGP**: Governance participation enabled by economic security  
- **BAZ Governance**: Local adaptation of payment structures
- **Social Resilience Council**: Global coordination and crisis response

## The LMCI Difference

Traditional economic metrics focus on GDP and productivity. AUBI measures success via the **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**:

**Love**: Care relationships, community support, mutual aid networks
**Meaning**: Cultural preservation, spiritual practice, purposeful contribution  
**Connection**: Human-land relationships, ecological stewardship, intergenerational wisdom

LMCI validates AUBI's effectiveness by tracking genuine community flourishing rather than just material consumption.

## Success Stories (Projected)

### Tanzania BAZ (2027)
*"With AUBI Layer 1 security, our Community Work Teams restored 500 hectares of watershed while elders taught traditional farming. Youth earned Hearts through mentorship while contributing to both care and ecological health."*

### Indigenous Canada (2028)  
*"AUBI respects our sovereignty while providing economic security. We adapted Layer 2 bonuses to honor our seasonal cycles and traditional knowledge sharing. The Love Ledger captures our true contributions beyond colonial economic measures."*

### Urban Sweden (2029)
*"The 15-hour workweek freed us for creativity and care. AUBI Layer 2 bonuses validate the work that truly matters - mentoring, art-making, community organizing. Our LMCI scores show deep improvements in social connection and life satisfaction."*

## Economic Justice Framework

AUBI directly addresses systemic inequalities:

### Reparative Justice (Layer 3)
- Historical injustices: Prioritized access and enhanced benefits for communities harmed by colonialism, slavery, and extractive capitalism
- Geographic equity: Higher payments for rural, remote, and under-resourced areas
- Disability inclusion: Accessibility support and care work recognition
- Gender equity: Validation of traditionally unpaid care work via Hearts currency

### Anti-Elite Capture
- Community Weaver oversight with cultural validation protocols
- Real-time monitoring and 48-hour response to gaming attempts  
- BAZ-level governance preventing top-down manipulation
- Transparent algorithms with community auditing capabilities

### Global South Priority
- Indigenous-led pilot development in Kenya, Brazil, Philippines
- Technology transfer and capacity building for local AUBI administration
- Cultural adaptation resources and traditional knowledge integration
- Economic sovereignty tools preventing extractive dependency

## Community Guidelines

AUBI operates under **Right Relationship** principles:

- **Reciprocity**: Contributions flow both ways between individuals and communities
- **Regeneration**: Economic activity must heal rather than harm ecological and social systems  
- **Justice**: Past harms must be acknowledged and addressed through reparative mechanisms
- **Sovereignty**: Communities control their own participation and cultural adaptation
- **Accessibility**: Full inclusion regardless of ability, technology access, or literacy level
- **Transparency**: Open algorithms and community oversight of all AUBI operations
